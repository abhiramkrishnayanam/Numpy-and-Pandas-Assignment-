# Numpy-and-Pandas-Assignment-

This repository serves as a beginner-friendly guide to NumPy and Pandas, two essential Python libraries for data manipulation,
analysis, and scientific computing. It contains examples, tutorials, and practical projects to help you get started.
## Numerical Python
NumPy is a powerful Python library used for numerical computing. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.
It is one of the core libraries for scientific computing in Python and is widely used in machine learning, data analysis, and scientific research.

## Core Concepts:
Arrays: Creating NumPy arrays and understanding their properties.<br>
Array Operations: Basic arithmetic operations on arrays.<br>
Indexing and Slicing: Accessing and modifying array elements.<br>
Reshaping Arrays: Changing the shape of arrays without changing the data.<br>
Broadcasting: Performing operations on arrays of different shapes.<br>
Mathematical Functions: Using built-in mathematical functions on arrays.<br>



## Pandas - Data Analysis and Manipulation Library
Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and data manipulation library built on top of the Python programming language.
It provides data structures such as DataFrame and Series that make it simple to handle and analyze structured data.

### Key Features
DataFrame: A 2D size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure.<br>
Series: A 1D labeled array capable of holding any data type.<br>
Data manipulation: Merge, join, group, filter, reshape, and manipulate data easily.<br>
Data Cleaning: Handle missing data, replace values, and apply transformations.<br>
Time Series: Work with time series data and perform operations like resampling, shifting, and time-based indexing.<br>
I/O operations: Read and write data to/from CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, and other file formats.<br>
